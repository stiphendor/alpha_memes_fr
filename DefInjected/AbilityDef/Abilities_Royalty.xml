  <!-- EN: Forcefully extract the latent psychic energy from a downed foe. Animals don't have enough intelligence to be of any use in this regard.\n\nIf the person casting the ability doesn't have psychic powers, they'll just receive a minor healing effect and a mood boost. If the person does have at least level 1 psychic powers this ability will recharge his or her focus, but will generate 30% of maximum psychic heat. -->
